# This is my grow up for myself with my coming baby---Tanxi

    As every born child ,we are willing to learn everything we touch,see,feel.This day ,I retry to learn some thing about keyboard and English .One step may be a big success.Just master typing without look the keyboard.Sounds easy!But when I try,oh my god,it seems that I even don't know what the numbers stand for when the key 'Shift' is down.
    Here is the review.
